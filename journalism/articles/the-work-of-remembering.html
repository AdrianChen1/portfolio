    <article class="article-content reveal">
        <p>From her front windows, Carla Fortmann can see the Lexington Battle Green.</p>

        <p>She does not see it as a backdrop or a monument. She sees it as something alive. Something worked on,
            interpreted, and continually cared for. For more than four decades, Fortmann has helped ensure that the
            history surrounding the Green, particularly at Buckman Tavern, remains not just preserved, but understood.
        </p>

        <p>Fortmann moved to Lexington in 1980, purchasing a house that directly faces the Green. That proximity quickly
            became a responsibility. Almost immediately, she joined the Lexington Historical Society (now Lexington
            History Museums), beginning what would become a lifelong relationship with the town's historic sites. Over
            the years, she has served as a guide at Buckman Tavern, Hancock-Clarke House, and Munroe Tavern, sat on the
            board of Lexington History Museums, and led its interpretation committee, authoring a book recounting
            Lexington's historical legacy.</p>

        <p>Her involvement was never ornamental. It was, and remains, deeply practical.</p>

        <p>"In the early days," Fortmann explained, "you became a town with a church." But the church alone was not
            enough. In New England villages, the church and the tavern were almost always paired together. They formed
            the social and economic backbone of the community. People relied on both, not just for worship or drink, but
            for shelter, food, connection, and survival.</p>

        <p>Buckman Tavern sits directly across the Green for that reason. She describes, "in winter months, when travel
            was difficult, people who lived far from the meetinghouse would gather at the tavern for warmth and
            nourishment."</p>

        <p>The tavern also served as a working space. Located along a key route into Boston, it became known as the
            first service drovers' tavern. Farmers bringing sheep and pigs to market could stop there easily. "They
            could eat, drink a pint of ale, and stay overnight," Fortmann says.</p>

        <p>What makes Buckman Tavern especially powerful today, Fortmann noted, is how little of it has changed. The
            taproom, kitchen, and west room remain largely as they were. Carefully restored, the building offers
            something increasingly rare: physical continuity. In 2026, the Buckman Tavern will have been a museum for
            over 100 years, even as the structure itself remains more than two centuries old.</p>

        <p>Each year, roughly 25,000 visitors pass through its doors.</p>

        <p>Fortmann has seen them arrive with curiosity, skepticism, reverence, and sometimes, overwhelming emotion. As
            a longtime greeter, Fortmann recounts, "people sometimes cry when they come here; people who are interested
            in history, witnessing the place where our country began." Those moments have stayed with her, as reminders
            that history, when encountered directly, still carries emotional force.</p>

        <p>"What people feel," Fortmann reflected, "is a sense of how life was lived in those days."</p>

        <p>That sense of lived experience is not accidental. It is the product of years of Fortmann's interpretive work,
            alongside many dozens of Lexington historians.</p>

        <p>Fortmann's work has extended beyond the building itself. Behind Buckman Tavern sits an herb garden originally
            designed by Helen Noyes Webster, who in the late 1800s became the first woman president of the Massachusetts
            Horticultural Society. Webster wrote extensively about herbs and designed the garden based on historical
            plant use. Original drawings survived, allowing for a historically accurate restoration.</p>

        <p>Fortmann played a key role in reviving that garden, ensuring that its plants reflected what could plausibly
            have grown there in the eighteenth century.</p>

        <p>This kind of historical preservation, Fortmann believes, is a form of stewardship. "I revere the fact that
            this town owns Buckman Tavern," she said fondly, noting that while the town holds ownership, the Lexington
            Historical Society has been responsible for its care since 1886. The preservation of history, of memory, in
            this sense, is not passive. It requires people willing to research, interpret, greet visitors, and carry
            Lexington's legacy onward.</p>

        <p>Fortmann's commitment to service extends beyond historical spaces. She is also a leader of Lexington's
            Interfaith Garden, which grows fresh produce for the Lexington Food Pantry. The project connects community
            cooperation—across faiths, backgrounds, and generations—to a long New England tradition of mutual reliance.
        </p>

        <p>Fortmann's message is consistent: history is not something to be admired at a distance. It is something to be
            worked on. To be remembered. To live on.</p>

        <p>Buckman Tavern endures because people like Carla Fortmann continue to show up—interpreting its rooms,
            welcoming visitors, and maintaining the link between past and present. The building remains standing, but it
            is the individuals and labor around it that give it meaning.</p>

        <p>In Lexington, remembrance does not reside solely in plaques or anniversaries. It lives in the act of tending
            to spaces, stories, and shared responsibility. Through that work, history remains active: a lived
            inheritance, carried forward by those willing to care for it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic; line-height: 1.8; color: #2E4057;">
                I worked closely with Carla Fortmann during my Eagle Scout project at Buckman Tavern, where I led a team
                of more than 20 individuals to refurbish the historic garden plot on the west and south-facing beds in
                preparation for Lexington's 250th Anniversary celebrations. Before the project, the garden was
                overgrown, declining, and overtaken by weeds. With Fortmann's guidance and historical research, we
                replanted the space with historically accurate and native plants aligned with documented eighteenth and
                nineteenth century use. Her role as a mentor and collaborator during this project provided firsthand
                insight into the sustained labor behind historical preservation and directly informed my reporting for
                this article.
