    <article class="article-content reveal">
        <p>On a Friday night in the summer of 2003, standing in the middle of one of his first fife and drum musters,
            Chris Myers felt his entire body change.</p>

        <p>It was his first real jam session: hundreds of fifes played at once, producing more sound than he had ever
            imagined possible. "I'll never forget it," he said. "It was like a religious experience." The noise was
            overwhelming, a visceral, physical sensation that reverberated throughout. He remembers standing there,
            surrounded by players, feeling as if the music itself had altered something internal. This was his first
            encounter not just with the sound, but with something communal and enduring.</p>

        <p>More than two decades later, that moment still anchors his relationship to the tradition, serving as a
            reminder of how memory often begins with feeling and passion.</p>

        <p>Myers is now the head fife instructor for the William Diamond Junior Fife and Drum Corps in Lexington,
            Massachusetts, where he teaches students ages 8 to 18 across all skill levels. He lives in Rhode Island and
            drives roughly an hour and a half every Monday evening to rehearsal, always arriving on time for the 6:30
            p.m. start. He is also a fife sergeant with the Kentish Guards corps of Rhode Island, a position he has held
            since 2004.</p>

        <p>Despite his deep involvement in Revolutionary-era music, history was not what first drew him in.</p>

        <p>Before fife and drum, Myers described himself as a "marching band nerd," someone already immersed in
            communal, movement-based music. After attending a 9/11 commemoration in 2002 that involved fife music, he
            reached out to Richard Sheryka, a longtime figure in the fife and drum community. The advice he received was
            simple: just show up. A few weeks later, in October 2002, he did.</p>

        <p>His first muster came the following spring, performing in the William Diamond Corps' first-ever muster in May
            2003,
            held on the Lexington Battle Green. Two months later, he attended the Deep River Muster in Connecticut. He
            stayed the entire weekend, camping with his family and friends. That Friday night jam session, as nearly 200
            players played in unison, creating more noise than he thought possible, was the turning point.</p>

        <p>What struck him the most was not just the music itself, but its scale. The fife, Myers explained, is quite
            accessible. It can be learned relatively quickly and played almost anywhere. But its power multiplies when
            played collectively, which makes sense, given its historical roots: the fife was generally played in battle
            for communication, capable of cutting across gunfire and cannon fire, relaying crucial commands to troops.
            Nowadays, fife and drum cultivates the atmosphere of revolutionary battlegrounds, fueled by many
            individuals, each playing their tune. Myers likened it to being part of a major concert or sporting event,
            moments when individual awareness gives way to a shared emotional current, when the crowd itself becomes
            part of the meaning.</p>

        <p>That collective experience, the sounds, the atmosphere, the people, was what kept him coming back, suggesting
            that continuity depends as much on participation as preservation.</p>

        <p>"The music really spoke to me," Myers said. "I found the history interesting, but it was never really a
            driving factor for me." He does not dismiss the historical significance of fife and drum music; he
            acknowledges it as a historical art form and respects that others are drawn to it primarily for that reason.
            But for him, the attachment began with sound and community.</p>

        <p>Myers' experience suggests a different mechanism at work: historical memory sustained not by reverence alone,
            but by emotional and musical engagement. People stay with the tradition because they feel something first.
            And through that feeling, the past carries into the present.</p>

        <p>Teaching entered his life much the same way—gradually, and without intention. In 2004, he became a fife
            sergeant for the Kentish Guards. At the time, he had never taught children before. He began attending
            William Diamond rehearsals; slowly, he became more and more involved as an instructor. During the COVID-19
            pandemic, there was a dearth of volunteer teachers, but Myers rose to the occasion, formally becoming the
            corps' head fife instructor amidst the period of uncertainty.</p>

        <p>He describes the transition as something that "happened by accident." At first, he wasn't sure he even liked
            teaching. But as he explored it, he found meaning in watching students grow and in learning how to guide
            each one differently.</p>

        <p>"I can connect individually with a student and figure out what it is that will make them better," he said,
            particularly in one-on-one settings. His primary goal is straightforward: to make each student a better
            player than they were the day before while making sure they are still having fun while doing it. Enjoyment,
            he believes, is what keeps the tradition alive.</p>

        <p>Rehearsals under Myers are serious and focused. He emphasizes posture, tuning, and precision, and his
            students are attentive and visibly respectful. But his seriousness is not rigid. "Not just [as] fifers," he
            said. "I want people to get the music." For Myers, teaching is not about getting students to blindly read
            notes, imposing one interpretation over another. "At its heart," he added, "music is art."</p>

        <p>That philosophy extends to how he thinks about historical authenticity. Myers is careful not to claim access
            to an unknowable past. "We don't really know what performance practices were like 250 years ago," he said.
            The original intent of fife and drum music was more functional, keeping troops in step and signaling certain
            commands, rather than refined performance and interpretation.</p>

        <p>He does not present this as a problem to be solved. People come to the tradition for different reasons, he
            noted, and those motivations are all valid. His own simply began with the music itself.</p>

        <p>More than twenty years after that first muster weekend, the moment Myers describes as religious continues to
            echo through his work. It can be heard in his thoughtful classes, rehearsals, performances, and in the quiet
            progress of students trying to listen—to themselves, to one another, and to the collective sound they help
            create. The history is there, embedded in the music. But it is the music that keeps it alive.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic; line-height: 1.8; color: #2E4057;">
                Chris Myers has been my fife and drum instructor since 2025 through the William Diamond Junior Fife and
                Drum Corps. While this article is reported and written with journalistic intent, my perspective is
                informed by my experience as his student. Over the past year, he has played a significant role in
                improving my technical skills, and, more importantly, in motivating me to practice and engage more
                deeply with the music. His instruction reflects a genuine care for each student's individual experience
                with the fife, which informed both my interest in interviewing him and the framing of this piece.
