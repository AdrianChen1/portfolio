Build a clean portfolio website using plain HTML and CSS for a high school student journalist and photographer. The site should have a clean editorial design prioritizing readability, accessibility, and long-term credibility. Modern and well-polished. Needs to work on mobile device and desktop computer with responsive web design. Include the following pages: Home, Journalism, Photography, Projects, About, and Contact, with consistent top navigation on every page. Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, article, footer), a single-column layout with generous margins, neutral colors, and minimal typography (one body font, one heading font). The Home page should briefly state the site’s focus on historical memory, Revolutionary-era traditions, and living public history, and allow the featuring of 3–4 highlighted works. All of my posts are in markdown files and the 'posts' on the Journalism section should be generated from those files. Journalism pages should present reported articles with titles, dates, publications, short nut grafs, and optional context boxes. Photo art placed into album folders and html design should incorporate photos to allow browsing of all photos as if in a clean and cohesive portfolio. Photography and Projects pages should be organized by clearly explained projects, including a long-term project titled “Revolutionary Spirit,” described as an ongoing photo series using ghosted imagery to explore continuity between historical tradition and modern life. The site should be fully responsive.
