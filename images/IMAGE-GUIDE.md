## Creating Placeholder Images

Until you have your actual content ready, you can use placeholder images:

1. **Online Services:**
   - https://placehold.co/ - Simple placeholder generator
   - https://picsum.photos/ - Random stock photos
   - https://unsplash.com/ - High-quality free photos

2. **Quick Placeholders:**
   Replace any image path with: `https://placehold.co/800x600/1A1A1A/FFFFFF?text=Your+Text`

3. **Recommended Dimensions:**
   - Hero images: 1920x1080px
   - Card images: 600x400px
   - Article featured images: 1200x600px
   - Gallery images: 800x600px (or higher for quality)

## Image Optimization

Before uploading images:
1. **Resize** images to appropriate dimensions
2. **Compress** using tools like:
   - https://squoosh.app/
   - https://tinypng.com/
3. **Target file size:** Under 500KB for fast loading
4. **Format:** Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

## Adding Your Images

1. Place images in the correct folder
2. Name them exactly as shown in this guide (or update the HTML references)
3. Ensure file extensions match (jpg vs jpeg)
4. Test all pages to confirm images load correctly

## Future Content

As you create new articles or photography projects:
1. Create new folders: `images/articles/[article-name]/`
2. Add images to these folders
3. Reference them in your markdown files
4. Keep file sizes optimized for web

*Tip: Start with a few placeholder images to see how the site looks, then gradually replace them with your actual content.*
