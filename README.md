# Adrian Chen Portfolio

This website serves as a public portfolio for my work as a high school journalist and photographer. The site brings together reported articles, photo essays, and long-term visual projects that examine how historical memory is preserved, performed, and reinterpreted in the present.

My work focuses in particular on Revolutionary-era traditions, music, and living history in New England. Through reporting and photography, I document the ways history exists not only in archives and monuments, but in sound, ritual, landscape, and everyday community practice.

The site is designed to be minimal, accessible, and content-first, functioning both as a professional portfolio and as a long-term archive for ongoing work.

All writing, photography, and visual materials on this site are original content unless otherwise noted.
